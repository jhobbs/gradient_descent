# gradient_descent
Some gradient descent animations.

This uses sympy to differentiate functions of two inputs, and matplotlib to graph them. It uses a simple gradient descent algorithm, drawing points for each stop on the way. It has sliders to change the effect of learning rate and precision.

I made this as part of my final project for my Calculus 3 Class @ Austin Community College.
